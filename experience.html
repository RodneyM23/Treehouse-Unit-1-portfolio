        <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I worked in a meter-based role where I installed and serviced meters while traveling throughout the state. The job required accurately locating sites using GPS, following detailed work orders, and ensuring each installation was completed correctly and documented properly. I regularly worked independently in different locations, adapting to changing environments and schedules.
</p>

<p>
This role strengthened my ability to stay organized, manage time efficiently, and maintain a high level of accuracy while working on the move. Traveling extensively and working independently built problem-solving skills and accountability that translate directly to web development, where attention to detail, consistency, and self-direction are essential.
